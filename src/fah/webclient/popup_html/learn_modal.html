                <p>Scientists at universities around the world
                    utilize your donated computer time to better understand and develop cures
                    for some of humanity's worst diseases. Simply by running Folding@home
                    software you are aiding research for Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and many
                    cancers.</p>
                <p>People like you, from all over the globe, currently
                    donate the unused power of over a quarter of a million processors, forming
                    one of the world's most powerful distributed super-computers.</p>

                        <h4>The Science</h4>
                        <p>Proteins help fight disease by first assembling themselves or
                            "folding". When proteins misfold, there can be serious health
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>If we better understand protein misfolding we can design drugs and
                            therapies to combat these illnesses.</p>

                        <h4>The Software</h4>
                        <p>Folding@home software aids research by simulating protein folding.
                            The calculations are immense so we break them into small "work units"
                            and pass them to individual computers like yours to solve.</p>
                        <p>Folding@home computers assemble data from thousands of work units
                            into meaningful answers to important scientific questions.</p>

                        <h4>Get Involved</h4>
                        <p>One of the best ways to help Folding@home is by recruiting your
                            friends and family. Start by sharing our project with them.</p>
                        <p>Then <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/">join a team</a> or even <a
                                href="https://apps.foldingathome.org/team/create">start your own team</a>. The more
                            points you and
                            your
                            team earn, the
                            closer we come to finding cures.</p>
                        <p>Our non-profit organization also accepts <a
